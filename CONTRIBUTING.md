# Contributing to pyGSTi

Thanks for taking the time to contribute to pyGSTi! Open-source
projects like ours couldn't exist without contributors like you.

This document contains a set of guidelines for contributing to pyGSTi
and related packages hosted under the [pyGSTio group][pygstio]. We ask
that contributors make an earnest effort to follow these guidelines,
but no one's keeping score here -- just use your best judgement, and
by all means, feel free to propose changes to these guidelines in a
pull request.

### Reporting Bugs

Found a bug in pyGSTi? We'd appreciate letting us know!

* First, **see if the bug has already been reported** by searching on
  Github under [Issues][issues].

* If you can't find an open issue about the problem,
  [open a new one][issues:new]! Be sure to include a **title**, a
  **clear description** of what went wrong, and **as much relevant
  information as possible.** If you can, try to include detailed steps
  to reproduce the problem.

* Once you open an issue, please **keep an eye on it** -- you may be
  asked to provide more details.

### Suggesting Features & Enhancements

Want to add a new feature or change an existing one?

* First, **see if the feature or enhancement has already been
  suggested** by searching on Github under [Issues][issues].

* If you can't find a similar suggestion in the issue tracker,
  [open a new issue][issues:new] for your feature suggestion.

### Making a Contribution

Want to fix a bug, add a feature, or change an existing feature?

Because pyGSTi is a project of the Quantum Performance Lab at Sandia
National Labs, the process of contributing to pyGSTi is different for
contributors working at Sandia.

#### For non-Sandians

Unfortunately, **we can't currently accept pull requests from
contributors outside of SNL.** We're working on setting up a
contributor license agreement, so, someday, this may change. Check
back later!

#### For Sandians

* **Contact the authors** at [pygsti@sandia.gov][email] to
  request an invite to the [pyGSTio group][pygstio].

* **Follow the guidelines** [on the project wiki][contributing].

    """
    Compiles an n-qubit Clifford gate, described by the symplectic matrix s and vector p, into
    a circuit over the specified model, or, a standard model. Clifford gates/circuits can be converted
    to, or sampled in, the symplectic representation using the functions in pygsti.tools.symplectic.

    The circuit created by this function will be over a user-specified model and respects any desired
    connectivity, if a ProcessorSpec object is provided. Otherwise, it is over a canonical model containing
    all-to-all CNOTs, Hadamard, Phase, 3 products of Hadamard and Phase, and the Pauli gates.

    Parameters
    ----------
    s : array over [0,1]
        An (2n X 2n) symplectic matrix of 0s and 1s integers.

    p : array over [0,1]
        A length-2n vector over [0,1,2,3] that, together with s, defines a valid n-qubit Clifford
        gate.

    pspec : ProcessorSpec, optional
        An nbar-qubit ProcessorSpec object that encodes the device that the Clifford is being compiled
        for, where nbar >= n. If this is specified, the output circuit is over the gates available
        in this device. If this is None, the output circuit is over the "canonical" model of CNOT gates
        between all qubits, consisting of "H", "HP", "PH", "HPH", "I", "X", "Y" and "Z", which is the set
        used internally for the compilation. In most circumstances, the output will be more useful if a
        ProcessorSpec is provided.

        If nbar > n it is necessary to provide `subsetQs`, that specifies which of the qubits in `pspec`
        the Clifford acts on. (All other qubits will not be part of the returned circuit, regardless of
        whether that means an over-head is required to avoid using gates that act on those qubits. If these
        additional qubits should be used, then the input Clifford needs to be ``padded'' to be the identity
        on those qubits).

        The ordering of the indices in (`s`,`p`) is w.r.t to ordering of the qubit labels in pspec.qubit_labels,
        unless `subsetQs` is specified. Then, the ordering is taken w.r.t the ordering of the list `subsetQs`.

    subsetQs : List, optional
        Required if the Clifford to compile is over less qubits than `pspec`. In this case this is a
        list of the qubits to compile the Clifford for; it should be a subset of the elements of
        pspec.qubit_labels. The ordering of the qubits in (`s`,`p`) is taken w.r.t the ordering of this list.

    iterations : int, optional
        Some of the allowed algorithms are randomized. This is the number of iterations used in
        algorithm if it is a randomized algorithm specified. If any randomized algorithms are specified,
        the time taken by this function increases linearly with `iterations`. Increasing `iterations`
        will often improve the obtained compilation (the "cost" of the obtained circuit, as specified
        by `costfunction` may decrease towards some asymptotic value).

    algorithm : str, optional
        Specifies the algorithm used for the core part of the compilation: finding a circuit that is a Clifford
        with `s` the symplectic matrix in its symplectic representation (a circuit that implements that desired
        Clifford up to Pauli operators). The allowed values of this are:

        - 'BGGE': A basic, deterministic global Gaussian elimination algorithm. Circuits obtained from this algorithm
           contain, in expectation, O(n^2) 2-qubit gates. Although the returned circuit will respect device
           connectivity, this algorithm does *not* take connectivity into account in an intelligient way. More details
           on this algorithm are given in `compile_symplectic_with_ordered_global_gaussian_elimination()`; it is the
           algorithm described in that docstring but with the qubit ordering fixed to the order in the input `s`.

        - 'ROGGE': A randomized elimination order global Gaussian elimination algorithm. This is the same algorithm
           as 'BGGE' except that the order that the qubits are eliminated in is randomized. This results in significantly
           lower-cost circuits than the 'BGGE' method (given sufficiently many iterations). More details are given in
           the `compile_symplectic_with_random_ordered_global_gaussian_elimination()` docstring.

         - 'iAGvGE': Our improved version of the Aaraonson-Gottesman method for compiling a Clifford circuit, which
           uses 3 CNOT circuits and 3 1Q-gate layers (rather than the 5 CNOT circuit used in the algorithm of AG in
           Phys. Rev. A 70 052328 (2004)), with the CNOT circuits compiled using Gaussian elimination. Note that this
           algorithm appears to perform substantially worse than 'ROGGE', even though with an upgraded CNOT compiler
           it is asymptotically optimal (unlike any of the GGE methods). Also, note that this algorithm is randomized:
           there are many possible CNOT circuits (with non-equivalent action, individually) for the 2 of the 3 CNOT
           stages, and we randomize over those possible circuits. This randomization is equivalent to the randomization
           used in the stabilizer state/measurement compilers.

    aargs : list, optional
        If the algorithm can take optional arguments, not already specified as separate arguments above, then
        this list is passed to the compile_symplectic algorithm as its final arguments.

    costfunction : function or string, optional
        If a function, it is a function that takes a circuit and `pspec` as the first and second inputs and
        returns a 'cost' (a float) for the circuit. The circuit input to this function will be over the gates in
        `pspec`, if a `pspec` has been provided, and as described above if not. This costfunction is used to decide
        between different compilations when randomized algorithms are used: the lowest cost circuit is chosen. If
        a string it must be one of:

            - '2QGC' : the cost of the circuit is the number of 2-qubit gates it contains.
            - 'depth' : the cost of the circuit is the depth of the circuit.
            - '2QGC:x:depth:y' : the cost of the circuit is x * the number of 2-qubit gates in the circuit +
                y * the depth of the circuit, where x and y are integers.

    prefixpauli : bool, optional
        The circuits are constructed by finding a circuit that implements the correct Clifford up to Pauli
        operators, and then attaching a (compiled) Pauli layer to the start or end of this circuit. If this
        bool is True (False) the Pauli layer is (pre-) post-fixed.

    paulirandomize : bool, optional
        If True then independent, uniformly random Pauli layers (a Pauli on each qubit) are inserted in between
        every layer in the circuit. These Paulis are then compiled into the gates in `pspec`, if `pspec` is provided.
        That is, this Pauli-frame-randomizes / Pauli-twirls the internal layers of this Clifford circuit. This can
        be useful for preventing coherent addition of errors in the circuit.

    Parameters
    ----------
    s : array over [0,1]
        An (2n X 2n) symplectic matrix of 0s and 1s integers.

    pspec : ProcessorSpec, optional

    iterations : int, optional

        each algorithm specified that is a randomized algorithm.

    algorithms : list of strings, optional
        Specifies the algorithms used. If more than one algorithm is specified, then all the algorithms
        are implemented and the lowest "cost" circuit obtained from all the algorithms (and iterations of
        those algorithms, if randomized) is returned.

        The allowed elements of this list are:

        - 'BGGE': A basic, deterministic global Gaussian elimination algorithm. Circuits obtained from this algorithm

        - 'ROGGE': A randomized elimination order global Gaussian elimination algorithm. This is the same algorithm
           as 'BGGE' except that the order that the qubits are eliminated in is randomized. This results in significantly
           lower-cost circuits than the 'BGGE' method (given sufficiently many iterations). More details are given in

         - 'iAGvGE': Our improved version of the Aaraonson-Gottesman method for compiling a symplectic matrix, which
           uses 3 CNOT circuits and 3 1Q-gate layers (rather than the 5 CNOT circuit used in the algorithm of AG in

                y * the depth of the circuit, where x and y are integers.

    paulirandomize : bool, optional

    qubit elimination order randomized. See that function for further details on the algorithm, This algorithm
    is more conveniently and flexibly accessed via the `compile_symplectic()` or  `compile_clifford()` wrap-around
    functions.

    Parameters
    ----------
    s : array over [0,1]
        An (2n X 2n) symplectic matrix of 0s and 1s integers.

    pspec : ProcessorSpec, optional
        An nbar-qubit ProcessorSpec object that encodes the device that `s` is being compiled
        for, where nbar >= n. If this is specified, the output circuit is over the gates available
        in this device. If this is None, the output circuit is over the "canonical" model of CNOT gates
        between all qubits, consisting of "H", "HP", "PH", "HPH", "I", "X", "Y" and "Z", which is the set
        used internally for the compilation.

        If nbar > n it is necessary to provide `subsetQs`, that specifies which of the qubits in `pspec`
        the Clifford acts on. (All other qubits will not be part of the returned circuit, regardless of
        whether that means an over-head is required to avoid using gates that act on those qubits. If these
        additional qubits should be used, then the input `s`  needs to be ``padded'' to be the identity
        on those qubits).

        The indexing `s` is assumed to be the same as that in the list pspec.qubit_labels, unless `subsetQs`
        is specified. Then, the ordering is taken w.r.t the ordering of the list `subsetQs`.

    subsetQs : List, optional
        Required if the Clifford to compile is over less qubits than `pspec`. In this case this is a
        list of the qubits to compile the Clifford for; it should be a subset of the elements of pspec.qubit_labels.
        The ordering of the qubits in (`s`,`p`) is taken w.r.t the ordering of this list.

    ctype : str, optional
        The particular variant on the global Gaussian elimiation core algorithm. Currently there is only one
        such variant, corresponding to the string "basic".

    iterations : int, optional
        The number of different random orderings tried. The lowest "cost" circuit obtained from the
        different orderings is what is returned.

    costfunction : function or string, optional
        If a function, it is a function that takes a circuit and `pspec` as the first and second inputs and
        returns a cost (a float) for the circuit. The circuit input to this function will be over the gates in
        `pspec`, if a `pspec` has been provided, and as described above if not. This costfunction is used to decide
        between different compilations when randomized algorithms are used: the lowest cost circuit is chosen. If
        a string it must be one of:

            - '2QGC' : the cost of the circuit is the number of 2-qubit gates it contains.
            - 'depth' : the cost of the circuit is the depth of the circuit.
            - '2QGC:x:depth:y' : the cost of the circuit is x * the number of 2-qubit gates in the circuit +
                y * the depth of the circuit, where x and y are integers.

    check : bool, optional
        Whether to check that the output circuit implements the correct symplectic matrix (i.e., tests for algorithm
        success).

    """
    An ordered global Gaussian elimiation algorithm for creating a circuit that implements a Clifford that is represented
    by the symplectic matrix `s` (and *some* phase vector). This algorithm is more conveniently and flexibly accessed via
    the `compile_symplectic()` or  `compile_clifford()` wrap-around functions.

    The algorithm works as follows:

    1. The `s` matrix is permuted so that the index for the jth qubit to eliminate becomes index j.
    2. The "global Gaussian elimination" algorithm of E. Hostens, J. Dehaene, and B. De Moor, PRA 71 042315 (2015) is
       implemented, which can be used to decompose `s` into a circuit over CNOT, SWAP, H, and P. That algorithm is for
       d-dimensional qudits, and simplifies significantly for d=2 (qubits), which is the case implemented here. However,
       we are unware of anywhere else that this algorithm is clearly stated for the qubit case (although this basic
       algorithm is widely known).

        `pspec` is not specified this list should consist of the integers between 0 and n-1 in any order, corresponding
        to the indices of `s`.

        An nbar-qubit ProcessorSpec object that encodes the device that `s` is being compiled

    """
    Our improved version of Aaraonson-Gottesman method [PRA 70 052328 (2014)] for compiling a symplectic matrix
    using 5 CNOT circuits + local layers. Our version of this algorithm uses 3 CNOT circuits, and 3 layers of
    1-qubit gates. Also, note that this algorithm is randomized: there are many possible CNOT circuits (with
    non-equivalent action, individually) for the 2 of the 3 CNOT stages, and we randomize over those possible
    circuits. This randomization is equivalent to the randomization used in the stabilizer state/measurement
    compilers.

    Note that this algorithm currently performs substantially worse than 'ROGGE', even though with an upgraded
    CNOT compiler it is asymptotically optimal (unlike any of the GGE methods).

    Parameters
    ----------
    s : array over [0,1]
        An (2n X 2n) symplectic matrix of 0s and 1s integers.

    pspec : ProcessorSpec
        An nbar-qubit ProcessorSpec object that encodes the device that `s` is being compiled
        for, where nbar >= n. If this is specified, the output circuit is over the gates available
        in this device. If this is None, the output circuit is over the "canonical" model of CNOT gates
        between all qubits, consisting of "H", "HP", "PH", "HPH", "I", "X", "Y" and "Z", which is the set
        used internally for the compilation.

        If nbar > n it is necessary to provide `subsetQs`, that specifies which of the qubits in `pspec`
        the Clifford acts on. (All other qubits will not be part of the returned circuit, regardless of
        whether that means an over-head is required to avoid using gates that act on those qubits. If these
        additional qubits should be used, then the input `s`  needs to be ``padded'' to be the identity
        on those qubits).

        The indexing `s` is assumed to be the same as that in the list pspec.qubit_labels, unless `subsetQs`
        is specified. Then, the ordering is taken w.r.t the ordering of the list `subsetQs`.

    subsetQs : List, optional
        Required if the Clifford to compile is over less qubits than `pspec`. In this case this is a
        list of the qubits to compile the Clifford for; it should be a subset of the elements of pspec.qubit_labels.
        The ordering of the qubits in (`s`,`p`) is taken w.r.t the ordering of this list.

    iterations : int, optional
        The number of different random orderings tried. The lowest "cost" circuit obtained from the
        different orderings is what is returned.

    cnotalg : str, optional
        The CNOT compiler to use. See `compile_cnot_circuit()` for the options. The default is *probably*
        the current best CNOT circuit compiler in pyGSTI.

    cargs : list, optional
        Arguments handed to the CNOT compilation algorithm. For some choices of `cnotalg` this is not
        optional.

    costfunction : function or string, optional
        If a function, it is a function that takes a circuit and `pspec` as the first and second inputs and
        returns a cost (a float) for the circuit. The circuit input to this function will be over the gates in
        `pspec`, if a `pspec` has been provided, and as described above if not. This costfunction is used to decide
        between different compilations when randomized algorithms are used: the lowest cost circuit is chosen. If
        a string it must be one of:

            - '2QGC' : the cost of the circuit is the number of 2-qubit gates it contains.
            - 'depth' : the cost of the circuit is the depth of the circuit.
            - '2QGC:x:depth:y' : the cost of the circuit is x * the number of 2-qubit gates in the circuit +
                y * the depth of the circuit, where x and y are integers.

    check : bool, optional
        Whether to check that the output circuit implements the correct symplectic matrix (i.e., tests for algorithm
        success).

    Returns
    -------
    Circuit
        A circuit implementing the input symplectic matrix.

    A CNOT circuit compiler. Takes an arbitrary CNOT circuit, input as a symplectic matrix `s` that corresponds
    to the matrix portion of the symplectic representation of this Clifford circuit, and decomposes it into a
    sequences of gates from the processor spec `pspec`.

    Parameters
    ----------
    s : array over [0,1]
        An (2n X 2n) symplectic matrix of 0s and 1s integers that represents a Clifford circuit: so
        it must be block-diagonal. Specifically, it has the form s = ((A,0),(0,B)) where B is the
        inverse transpose of A (over [0,1] mod 2).

    pspec : ProcessorSpec
        An nbar-qubit ProcessorSpec object that encodes the device that `s` is being compiled
        for, where nbar >= n. If this is specified, the output circuit is over the gates available
        in this device. If this is None, the output circuit is over the "canonical" model of CNOT gates
        between all qubits, consisting of "H", "HP", "PH", "HPH", "I", "X", "Y" and "Z", which is the set
        used internally for the compilation.

        If nbar > n it is necessary to provide `subsetQs`, that specifies which of the qubits in `pspec`
        the Clifford acts on. (All other qubits will not be part of the returned circuit, regardless of
        whether that means an over-head is required to avoid using gates that act on those qubits. If these
        additional qubits should be used, then the input `s`  needs to be ``padded'' to be the identity
        on those qubits).

        The indexing `s` is assumed to be the same as that in the list pspec.qubit_labels, unless `subsetQs`
        is specified. Then, the ordering is taken w.r.t the ordering of the list `subsetQs`.

    subsetQs : list, optional
        Required if the Clifford to compile is over less qubits than `pspec`. In this case this is a
        list of the qubits to compile the Clifford for; it should be a subset of the elements of pspec.qubit_labels.
        The ordering of the qubits in (`s`,`p`) is taken w.r.t the ordering of this list.

    algorithm : str, optional
        The algorithm to use. The optionas are:

            - 'BGE' : A basic Gaussian elimination algorithm, that uses CNOT to perform row-reduction on the upper
                LHS (or lower RHS) of `s`. This algorithm does not take device connectivity into account.
            - 'OCAGE' : User-ordered connectivity-adjusted Gaussian elimination. The qubits are eliminated in the
                specified order; the first element of arrgs must be a list specify this order. The algorithm is
                also "connectivity-adjusted" in the sense that it uses the connectivity graph (in pspec.qubitgraph)
                to try and avoid using CNOTs between unconnected pairs whenever possible, and to decide the order
                of various operations.
            - 'OiCAGE' : The same as 'OCAGE' except that it has some improvements, and it requires connectivity
                graph of the remaining qubits, after each qubit has been 'eliminated', to be connected. In the current
                format this algorithm is only slightly better-performing than 'OCAGE', and only on average. (This
                algorithm will possibly be improved in the future, whereas 'OCAGE' will remain as-is for reproducability
                of previously obtained results.)
            - 'ROCAGE': Same as 'OCAGE' except that the elimination order is chosen at random, rather than user-
                specified.
             - 'COCAGE', 'COiCAGE' : The same as 'OCAGE' and 'OiCAGE', respectively, except that the elimination order
                is fixed to eliminate qubits with the worse connectivity before those with better connectivity.

    clname : str, optional
        A name for a CompilationLibrary in `pspec`, i.e., a key to the dict `pspec.compilationlibraries`. If
        specified, the output circuit is over the gates in `pspec` (rather than over CNOT), with the replacement
        according to this specified CompilationLibrary. If it is only necessary to implement the correct circuit
        up to paulis this would be `paulieq`. To obtain a compilation that exactly implements the input CNOT circuit
        this should be set to `absolute`. (Although user-added compilation libraries are also fine).

    check : bool, optional
        Whether to check the output is correct.

    aargs : list, optional
        A list of arguments handed to the CNOT compiler algorithm. For some choices of algorithm (e.g., 'OCAGE') this
        list must not be empty. For algorithms where there are X non-optional arguements *after* `s` and `pspec`
        these are specified as the first X arguments of aargs. The remaining elements in `aargs`, if any, are handed
        to the algorithm as the arguments after the optional `subsetQs` and `check` arguments (the first of which is
        set by the input `subsetQs` in this function).

    """
    An ordered and connectivity-adjusted Gaussian-elimination (OCAGE) algorithm for compiling a CNOT circuit.
    The algorithm takes as input a symplectic matrix `s`, that defines the action of a CNOT circuit, and it
    generates a CNOT circuit (converted to a native model, if requested) that implements the same unitary.

    The algorithm works by mapping s -> identity using CNOTs acting from the LHS and RHS. I.e., it finds two
    CNOT circuits Ccnot1, Ccnot2 such that symp(Ccnot1) * s * symp(Ccnot2) = identity (where symp(c) is the
    symplectic matrix representing the circuit c). A circuit implementing s is then obtained as
    rev(Cnot1)rev(Cnot2) where rev(c) denotes the reverse of circuit c.

    To find such circuits Ccnot1/2 we use the following algorithm. We eliminate the qubits in the order
    specified, whereby "eliminating" a qubit means mapping the column and row of `s` associated with that
    qubit to the identity column and row. To eliminate the ith qubit in the list we:

    1. Look at the current value of s[i,i]. If s[i,i] = 1 continue. Else, find the closest qubit to
    do a CNOT between i and that qubit to make s[i,i] = 1.
    2. List the remaining qubits to eliminate (the i+1th qubit onwards), and going from the qubit
       in this list that is further from i to the closest implement the following steps:
        2.1. Denote this qubit by ii.
        2.1 If s[ii,i] = 0, pass. Else, map s[ii,i] -> 0 with the following method:
            (a) find the shortest path from i -> ii,
            (b) If the shortest path contains already eliminated qubits, using a LHS-action SWAP-like
                set of chains of CNOTs along the shortest path i -> ii to do a CNOT from i -> ii whilst
                leaving all other qubits unchanged. Then skip to 2.3.
            (c) If the shortest path doesn't contain already eliminated qubits, do LHS-action CNOTs
                between neighbouring qubits along this path to set all the s matrix elements in the
                column s[:,i] for the qubits along this path to 1.
            (d) Use the qubit next to ii in this path to set s[ii,i] using a LHS-action CNOT, and don't
                undo any of the changes to the other qubits along that path.
       2.3. If s[i,ii] = 0, pass. Else, map s[i,ii] -> 0 as in step 2.3 except that now we use RHS-action
            CNOTs.

    Steps 1 - 3 do not change the already eliminated qubits, so after steps 1 - 2 are repeated for each
    of the yet-to-be-eliminated qubits, s should be some smaller matrix s' between the yet-to-be-eliminated
    qubits embedded in a identity matrix on the already eliminated qubits.

    Parameters
    ----------
    s : array over [0,1]
        An (2n X 2n) symplectic matrix of 0s and 1s integers, that represents the CNOT circuit. This should
        be a (2x2) block-diagonal matrix, whereby the upper left block is any invertable transformation over
        [0,1]^n, and the lower right block is the inverse transpose of this transformation.

    pspec : ProcessorSpec
        An nbar-qubit ProcessorSpec object that encodes the device that the CNOT circuit is being compiled
        for, where nbar >= n. The algorithm is takes into account the connectivity of the device as specified
        by pspec.qubitgraph. The output circuit  is over the gates available  in this device is `clname` is
        not None. If nbar > n it is necessary to provide `subsetQs`, that specifies which of the qubits in `pspec`
        the CNOT circuit acts on (all other qubits will not be part of the returned circuit, regardless of
        whether that means an over-head is required to avoid using gates that act on those qubits. If these
        additional qubits should be used, then the input CNOT circuit needs to be ``padded'' to be the identity
        on those qubits). The ordering of the qubits in `s` is assumed to be the same as that in the list
        pspec.qubit_labels, unless `subsetQs` is specified. Then, the ordering is taken w.r.t the ordering of
        the list `subsetQs`.

    qubitorder : list
        A list of the qubit labels in the order in which they are to be eliminated. For auto-generated
        orderings use the compile_cnot_circuit() wrap-around function.

    subsetQs : list, optional
        Required if the CNOT circuit to compile is over less qubits than in `pspec`. In this case this is a
        list of the qubits to compile the CNOT circuit for; it should be a subset of the elements of
        pspec.qubit_labels. The ordering of the qubits in `s` is taken w.r.t the ordering of this list.

    respect_connectivity : bool, optional
        This algorithm takes the connectivity into account, but sometimes resorts to 'non-local' CNOTs. If
        `respect_connectivity` is True these gates are re-expressed over the available gates using a SWAP-like
        decomposition. If False, the algorithm does not compile these gates automatically. However, they will
        still be converted to native gates from `pspec` if `clname` is True, using whatever the user specified
        algorithm for compiling non-local CNOT gates this implies.

    clname : str, optional
        A string that is a key to `pspec.compilations` whereby `pspec.compilations[clname]` is a CompilationLibrary.
        This compilation library is then used to convert the CNOT gates in this circuit into the native gates
        in `pspec`. This is useful even if the device contains CNOT gates locally, as CNOT may have a different
        name in `pspec` (e.g., 'Gcnot').

    check : bool, optional
        Whether to check the algorithm was successful.

    Generates a circuit to create the stabilizer state specified by `s` and `p` from the standard
    input state |0,0,0,...>. The circuit returned is over the model of the processor spec `pspec`.
    See `compile_stabilizer_state()` for the inverse of this.

    Parameters
    ----------
    s : array over [0,1]
        An (2n X 2n) symplectic matrix of 0s and 1s integers. This is a symplectic matrix representing
        any Clifford gate that, when acting on |0,0,0,...>, generates the desired stabilizer state.
        So `s` is not unique.

    p : array over [0,1]
        A length-2n vector over [0,1,2,3] that, together with s, defines a valid n-qubit Clifford
        gate. This phase vector matrix should, together with `s`, represent any Clifford gate that,
        when acting on |0,0,0,...>, generates the desired stabilizer state. So `p` is not unique.

    pspec : ProcessorSpec, optional
        An nbar-qubit ProcessorSpec object that encodes the device that the stabilizer is being compiled
        for, where nbar >= n. If this is specified, the output circuit is over the gates available
        in this device. If this is None, the output circuit is over the "canonical" model of CNOT gates
        between all qubits, consisting of "H", "HP", "PH", "HPH", "I", "X", "Y" and "Z", which is the set
        used internally for the compilation. In most circumstances, the output will be more useful if a
        ProcessorSpec is provided.

        If nbar > n it is necessary to provide `subsetQs`, that specifies which of the qubits in `pspec`
        the stabilizer is over. (All other qubits will not be part of the returned circuit, regardless of
        whether that means an over-head is required to avoid using gates that act on those qubits. If these
        additional qubits should be used, then the input (s,p) needs to be ``padded'' to be the identity
        on those qubits).

        The ordering of the indices in (`s`,`p`) is w.r.t to ordering of the qubit labels in pspec.qubit_labels,
        unless `subsetQs` is specified. Then, the ordering is taken w.r.t the ordering of the list `subsetQs`.

    subsetQs : List, optional
        Required if the stabilizer state is over less qubits than `pspec`. In this case this is a
        list of the qubits to compile the Clifford for; it should be a subset of the elements of
        pspec.qubit_labels. The ordering of the qubits in (`s`,`p`) is taken w.r.t the ordering of this list.

    iterations : int, optional
        This algorithm is randomized. This is the number of iterations used in the algorithm.
        the time taken by this function increases linearly with `iterations`. Increasing `iterations`
        will often improve the obtained compilation (the "cost" of the obtained circuit, as specified
        by `costfunction` may decrease towards some asymptotic value).

    paulirandomize : bool, optional
        If True then independent, uniformly random Pauli layers (a Pauli on each qubit) are inserted in between
        every layer in the circuit. These Paulis are then compiled into the gates in `pspec`, if `pspec` is provided.
        That is, this Pauli-frame-randomizes / Pauli-twirls the internal layers of this circuit. This can
        be useful for preventing coherent addition of errors in the circuit.

    algorithm : str, optional
        Our algorithm finds a circuit consisting of 1Q-gates - a CNOT circuit - 1Q-gates. The CNOT circuit
        is found using Gaussian elimination, and it can then be recompiled using a CNOT-circuit compiler.
        `algorithm` specifies the CNOT-compilation algorithm to use. The allowe values are all those algorithms
        that permisable in the `compile_cnot_circuit()` function. See the docstring of that function for more
        information. The default is likely to be the best out of the in-built CNOT compilers under most
        circumstances.

    aargs : list, optional
        If the CNOT compilation algorithm can take optional arguments, these are specified here. This is passed
        to compile_cnot_circuit() as `aarg`.

    costfunction : function or string, optional
        If a function, it is a function that takes a circuit and `pspec` as the first and second inputs and
        returns a 'cost' (a float) for the circuit. The circuit input to this function will be over the gates in
        `pspec`, if a `pspec` has been provided, and as described above if not. This costfunction is used to decide
        between different compilations when randomized algorithms are used: the lowest cost circuit is chosen. If
        a string it must be one of:

            - '2QGC' : the cost of the circuit is the number of 2-qubit gates it contains.
            - 'depth' : the cost of the circuit is the depth of the circuit.
            - '2QGC:x:depth:y' : the cost of the circuit is x * the number of 2-qubit gates in the circuit +
                y * the depth of the circuit, where x and y are integers.

    """
    Generates a circuit to map the stabilizer state specified by `s` and `p` to the standard
    state |0,0,0,...>. The circuit returned is over the model of the processor spec `pspec`.
    See `compile_stabilizer_state()` for the inverse of this. So, this circuit followed by a
    Z-basis measurement can be used to simulate a projection onto the stabilizer state C|0,0,0,...>
    where C is the Clifford represented by `s` and `p`.

    Parameters
    ----------
    s : array over [0,1]
        An (2n X 2n) symplectic matrix of 0s and 1s integers. This is a symplectic matrix representing
        any Clifford gate that, when acting on |0,0,0,...>, generates the stabilizer state that we need
        to map to |0,0,0,...>. So `s` is not unique.

    p : array over [0,1]
        A length-2n vector over [0,1,2,3] that, together with s, defines a valid n-qubit Clifford
        gate. This phase vector matrix should, together with `s`, represent any Clifford gate that,
        when acting on |0,0,0,...>, generates the stabilizer state that we need to map to |0,0,0,...>.
        So `p` is not unique.

    pspec : ProcessorSpec, optional
        An nbar-qubit ProcessorSpec object that encodes the device that the stabilizer is being compiled
        for, where nbar >= n. If this is specified, the output circuit is over the gates available
        in this device. If this is None, the output circuit is over the "canonical" model of CNOT gates
        between all qubits, consisting of "H", "HP", "PH", "HPH", "I", "X", "Y" and "Z", which is the set
        used internally for the compilation. In most circumstances, the output will be more useful if a
        ProcessorSpec is provided.

        If nbar > n it is necessary to provide `subsetQs`, that specifies which of the qubits in `pspec`
        the stabilizer is over. (All other qubits will not be part of the returned circuit, regardless of
        whether that means an over-head is required to avoid using gates that act on those qubits. If these
        additional qubits should be used, then the input (s,p) needs to be ``padded'' to be the identity
        on those qubits).

        The ordering of the indices in (`s`,`p`) is w.r.t to ordering of the qubit labels in pspec.qubit_labels,
        unless `subsetQs` is specified. Then, the ordering is taken w.r.t the ordering of the list `subsetQs`.

    subsetQs : List, optional
        Required if the stabilizer state is over less qubits than `pspec`. In this case this is a
        list of the qubits to compile the Clifford for; it should be a subset of the elements of
        pspec.qubit_labels. The ordering of the qubits in (`s`,`p`) is taken w.r.t the ordering of this list.

    iterations : int, optional
        This algorithm is randomized. This is the number of iterations used in the algorithm.
        the time taken by this function increases linearly with `iterations`. Increasing `iterations`
        will often improve the obtained compilation (the "cost" of the obtained circuit, as specified
        by `costfunction` may decrease towards some asymptotic value).

    paulirandomize : bool, optional
        If True then independent, uniformly random Pauli layers (a Pauli on each qubit) are inserted in between
        every layer in the circuit. These Paulis are then compiled into the gates in `pspec`, if `pspec` is provided.
        That is, this Pauli-frame-randomizes / Pauli-twirls the internal layers of this circuit. This can
        be useful for preventing coherent addition of errors in the circuit.

    algorithm : str, optional
        Our algorithm finds a circuit consisting of 1Q-gates - a CNOT circuit - 1Q-gates. The CNOT circuit
        is found using Gaussian elimination, and it can then be recompiled using a CNOT-circuit compiler.
        `algorithm` specifies the CNOT-compilation algorithm to use. The allowe values are all those algorithms
        that permisable in the `compile_cnot_circuit()` function. See the docstring of that function for more
        information. The default is likely to be the best out of the in-built CNOT compilers under most
        circumstances.

    aargs : list, optional
        If the CNOT compilation algorithm can take optional arguments, these are specified here. This is passed
        to compile_cnot_circuit() as `aarg`.

    costfunction : function or string, optional
        If a function, it is a function that takes a circuit and `pspec` as the first and second inputs and
        returns a 'cost' (a float) for the circuit. The circuit input to this function will be over the gates in
        `pspec`, if a `pspec` has been provided, and as described above if not. This costfunction is used to decide
        between different compilations when randomized algorithms are used: the lowest cost circuit is chosen. If
        a string it must be one of:

            - '2QGC' : the cost of the circuit is the number of 2-qubit gates it contains.
            - 'depth' : the cost of the circuit is the depth of the circuit.
            - '2QGC:x:depth:y' : the cost of the circuit is x * the number of 2-qubit gates in the circuit +
                y * the depth of the circuit, where x and y are integers.

    Given a symplectic `s` matrix of the form ((A,B),(C,D)) with the submatrix in the

    1. Finds an *invertable* M such that F = M M.T where F is the submatrix in position
    `position`, i.e., F is one of A, B, C and D. (this is known as an albert factorization).

    2. Applies a CNOT circuit from the LHS (if `optype` = 'row')  or RHS (if `optyp`='colum'))
    to `s` so that F - > M.

    For example, if s = ((A,I),(C,D)), `position` = 'LR' and `optype` = 'column' then it
    finds an M such that we may write s = ((A,I),(C,M M.T)) and it applies the CNOT circuit

    This function returns a CNOT circuit that performs this action, with this CNOT circuit
    obtained from basic Gaussian elimination on M. Note that neither the returned `s` nor

    1. C1 is a CNOT circuit
    2. C2 is a circuit with the form 1-qubit-gates -- CNOT circuit -- 1-qubit gates.
    3. The symplectic rep of the circuit consisting of C1 followed by C2 has the form ((.,B)(.,D))
    when s has the form ((A,B),(C,D)).

    Therefore, the circuit C2 acting on |0,0,0,...> generates the same stabilizer state (up to Paulis)
    as a circuit that has the symplectic rep (s,p) for any valid p. The circuit is only "conditionally"
    equivalent to another circuit with the rep (s,p) -- conditional on the input state -- which is the
    meaning of the name `compile_conditional_symplectic`.

    Parameters
    ----------
    s : array over [0,1]
        An (2n X 2n) symplectic matrix of 0s and 1s integers.

    pspec : ProcessorSpec, optional
        An nbar-qubit ProcessorSpec object that encodes the device that `s` is being "conditionally" compiled
        for, where nbar >= n. If nbar > n it is necessary to provide `subsetQs`, that specifies which of the
        qubits in `pspec` the stabilizer is over. (All other qubits will not be part of the returned circuit,
        regardless of whether that means an over-head is required to avoid using gates that act on those qubits.
        If these additional qubits should be used, then the input (s,p) needs to be ``padded'' to be the identity
        on those qubits). The ordering of the indices in (`s`,`p`) is w.r.t to ordering of the qubit labels in
        pspec.qubit_labels, unless `subsetQs` is specified. Then, the ordering is taken w.r.t the ordering of the
        list `subsetQs`.

    subsetQs : List, optional
        Required if the `s` is over less qubits than `pspec`. In this case this is a
        list of the qubits to compile the Clifford for; it should be a subset of the elements of
        pspec.qubit_labels. The ordering of the qubits in (`s`,`p`) is taken w.r.t the ordering of this list.

    calg : str, optional
        Our algorithm finds a circuit consisting of 1Q-gates - a CNOT circuit - 1Q-gates. The CNOT circuit
        is found using Gaussian elimination, and it can then be recompiled using a CNOT-circuit compiler.
        `calg` specifies the CNOT-compilation algorithm to use. The allowed values are all those algorithms
        that are permisable in the `compile_cnot_circuit()` function. See the docstring of that function for more
        information. The default is likely to be the best out of the in-built CNOT compilers under most
        circumstances. Note that this is only used to recompile the CNOT circuit in C2, because the main use
        for this function only needs C1 for reference, rather than as a part of a final output.

    cargs : list, optional
        If the CNOT compilation algorithm can take optional arguments, these are specified here. This is passed
        to compile_cnot_circuit() as `aarg`.

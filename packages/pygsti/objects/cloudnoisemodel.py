        """
        Create a n-qubit model using a low-weight and geometrically local
        error model with a common "global idle" operation.

        This type of model is referred to as a "cloud noise" model because
        noise specific to a gate may act on a neighborhood or cloud around
        the gate's target qubits.  This type of model is generally useful
        for performing GST on a multi-qubit system.

        The returned model is "standard", in that the following standard gate
        names may be specified as elements to `gate_names` without the need to
        supply their corresponding unitaries (as one must when calling
        the constructor directly):

        - 'Gx','Gy','Gz' : 1Q pi/2 rotations
        - 'Gxpi','Gypi','Gzpi' : 1Q pi rotations
        - 'Gh' : Hadamard
        - 'Gp' : phase
        - 'Gcphase','Gcnot','Gswap' : standard 2Q gates

        Furthermore, if additional "non-standard" gates are needed,
        they are specified by their *unitary* gate action, even if
        the final model propagates density matrices (as opposed
        to state vectors).

        Parameters
        ----------
        nQubits : int
            The number of qubits

        gate_names : list
            A list of string-type gate names (e.g. `"Gx"`) either taken from
            the list of builtin "standard" gate names given above or from the
            keys of `nonstd_gate_unitaries`.  These are the typically 1- and 2-qubit
            gates that are repeatedly embedded (based on `availability`) to form
            the resulting model.

        nonstd_gate_unitaries : dict, optional
            A dictionary of numpy arrays which specifies the unitary gate action
            of the gate names given by the dictionary's keys.

        availability : dict, optional
            A dictionary whose keys are the same gate names as in
            `gate_names` and whose values are lists of qubit-label-tuples.  Each
            qubit-label-tuple must have length equal to the number of qubits
            the corresponding gate acts upon, and specifies that the named gate
            is available to act on the specified qubits.  For example,
            `{ 'Gx': [(0,),(1,),(2,)], 'Gcnot': [(0,1),(1,2)] }` would cause
            the `1-qubit `'Gx'`-gate to be available for acting on qubits
            0, 1, or 2, and the 2-qubit `'Gcnot'`-gate to be availalbe to
            act on qubits 0 & 1 or 1 & 2.  Instead of a list of tuples, values of
            `availability` may take the special values `"all-permutations"` and
            `"all-combinations"`, which as their names imply, equate to all possible
            permutations and combinations of the appropriate number of qubit labels
            (deterined by the gate's dimension).  The default value `"all-edges"`
            equates to all the edges in the graph given by `geometry`.

        qubit_labels : tuple, optional
            The circuit-line labels for each of the qubits, which can be integers
            and/or strings.  Must be of length `nQubits`.  If None, then the
            integers from 0 to `nQubits-1` are used.

        geometry : {"line","ring","grid","torus"} or QubitGraph
            The type of connectivity among the qubits, specifying a
            graph used to define neighbor relationships.  Alternatively,
            a :class:`QubitGraph` object with node labels equal to
            `qubit_labels` may be passed directly.

        maxIdleWeight : int, optional
            The maximum-weight for errors on the global idle gate.

        maxSpamWeight : int, optional
            The maximum-weight for SPAM errors when `spamtype == "linblad"`.

        maxhops : int
            The locality constraint: for a gate, errors (of weight up to the
            maximum weight for the gate) are allowed to occur on the gate's
            target qubits and those reachable by hopping at most `maxhops` times
            from a target qubit along nearest-neighbor links (defined by the
            `geometry`).

        extraWeight1Hops : int, optional
            Additional hops (adds to `maxhops`) for weight-1 errors.  A value > 0
            can be useful for allowing just weight-1 errors (of which there are
            relatively few) to be dispersed farther from a gate's target qubits.
            For example, a crosstalk-detecting model might use this.

        extraGateWeight : int, optional
            Addtional weight, beyond the number of target qubits (taken as a "base
            weight" - i.e. weight 2 for a 2Q gate), allowed for gate errors.  If
            this equals 1, for instance, then 1-qubit gates can have up to weight-2
            errors and 2-qubit gates can have up to weight-3 errors.

        sparse : bool, optional
            Whether the embedded Lindblad-parameterized gates within the constructed
            `nQubits`-qubit gates are sparse or not.  (This is determied by whether
            they are constructed using sparse basis matrices.)  When sparse, these
            Lindblad gates take up less memory, but their action is slightly slower.
            Usually it's fine to leave this as the default (False), except when
            considering particularly high-weight terms (b/c then the Lindblad gates
            are higher dimensional and sparsity has a significant impact).

        sim_type : {"auto","matrix","map","termorder:<N>"}
            The type of forward simulation (probability computation) to use for the
            returned :class:`Model`.  That is, how should the model compute
            operation sequence/circuit probabilities when requested.  `"matrix"` is better
            for small numbers of qubits, `"map"` is better for larger numbers. The
            `"termorder"` option is designed for even larger numbers.  Usually,
            the default of `"auto"` is what you want.

        parameterization : {"P", "P terms", "P clifford terms"}
            Where *P* can be any Lindblad parameterization base type (e.g. CPTP,
            H+S+A, H+S, S, D, etc.) This is the type of parameterizaton to use in
            the constructed model.  Types without any "terms" suffix perform
            usual density-matrix evolution to compute circuit probabilities.  The
            other "terms" options compute probabilities using a path-integral
            approach designed for larger numbers of qubits (experts only).

        spamtype : { "static", "lindblad", "tensorproduct" }
            Specifies how the SPAM elements of the returned `Model` are formed.
            Static elements are ideal (perfect) operations with no parameters, i.e.
            no possibility for noise.  Lindblad SPAM operations are the "normal"
            way to allow SPAM noise, in which case error terms up to weight
            `maxSpamWeight` are included.  Tensor-product operations require that
            the state prep and POVM effects have a tensor-product structure; the
            "tensorproduct" mode exists for historical reasons and is *deprecated*
            in favor of `"lindblad"`; use it only if you know what you're doing.

        addIdleNoiseToAllGates: bool, optional
            Whether the global idle should be added as a factor following the
            ideal action of each of the non-idle gates.

        errcomp_type : {"gates","errorgens"}
            How errors are composed when creating layer operations in the returned
            model.  `"gates"` means that the errors on multiple gates in a single
            layer are composed as separate and subsequent processes.  Specifically,
            the layer operation has the form `Composed(target,idleErr,cloudErr)`
            where `target` is a composition of all the ideal gate operations in the
            layer, `idleErr` is idle error (`.operation_blks['layers']['globalIdle']`),
            and `cloudErr` is the composition (ordered as layer-label) of cloud-
            noise contributions, i.e. a map that acts as the product of exponentiated
            error-generator matrices.  `"errorgens"` means that layer operations
            have the form `Composed(target, error)` where `target` is as above and
            `error` results from composing the idle and cloud-noise error
            *generators*, i.e. a map that acts as the exponentiated sum of error
            generators (ordering is irrelevant in this case).

        independent_clouds : bool, optional
            Currently this must be set to True.  In a future version, setting to
            true will allow all the clouds of a given gate name to have a similar
            cloud-noise process, mapped to the full qubit graph via a stencil.

        verbosity : int, optional
            An integer >= 0 dictating how must output to send to stdout.

        Parameters
        ----------
        nQubits : int
            The number of qubits

        gatedict : dict
            A dictionary (an `OrderedDict` if you care about insertion order) which
            associates with string-type gate names (e.g. `"Gx"`) :class:`LinearOperator`,
            `numpy.ndarray` objects. When the objects may act on fewer than the total
            number of qubits (determined by their dimension/shape) then they are
            repeatedly embedded into `nQubits`-qubit gates as specified by `availability`.

        availability : dict, optional
            A dictionary whose keys are the same gate names as in
            `gatedict` and whose values are lists of qubit-label-tuples.  Each
            qubit-label-tuple must have length equal to the number of qubits
            the corresponding gate acts upon, and causes that gate to be
            embedded to act on the specified qubits.  For example,
            `{ 'Gx': [(0,),(1,),(2,)], 'Gcnot': [(0,1),(1,2)] }` would cause
            the `1-qubit `'Gx'`-gate to be embedded three times, acting on qubits
            0, 1, and 2, and the 2-qubit `'Gcnot'`-gate to be embedded twice,
            acting on qubits 0 & 1 and 1 & 2.  Instead of a list of tuples,
            values of `availability` may take the special values
            `"all-permutations"` and `"all-combinations"`, which as their names
            imply, equate to all possible permutations and combinations of the
            appropriate number of qubit labels (deterined by the gate's dimension).
            If a gate name (a key of `gatedict`) is not present in `availability`,
            the default is `"all-permutations"`.

        qubit_labels : tuple, optional
            The circuit-line labels for each of the qubits, which can be integers
            and/or strings.  Must be of length `nQubits`.  If None, then the
            integers from 0 to `nQubits-1` are used.

        geometry : {"line","ring","grid","torus"} or QubitGraph
            The type of connectivity among the qubits, specifying a
            graph used to define neighbor relationships.  Alternatively,
            a :class:`QubitGraph` object with node labels equal to
            `qubit_labels` may be passed directly.

        maxIdleWeight : int, optional
            The maximum-weight for errors on the global idle gate.

        maxSpamWeight : int, optional

    Parameters
    ----------
    qubitGraph : QubitGraph
        A graph giving the geometry (nearest-neighbor relations) of the qubits.

    maxWeight : int
        The maximum weight errors to include in the resulting gate.

    sparse : bool, optional
        Whether the embedded Lindblad-parameterized gates within the constructed
        gate are represented as sparse or dense matrices.  (This is determied by
        whether they are constructed using sparse basis matrices.)

    sim_type : {"matrix","map","termorder:<N>"}
        The type of forward simulation (probability computation) being used by
        the model this gate is destined for.  This affects what type of
        gate objects (e.g. `ComposedDenseOp` vs `ComposedOp`) are created.

    parameterization : str
        The type of parameterizaton for the constructed gate. E.g. "H+S",
        "H+S terms", "H+S clifford terms", "CPTP", etc.

    errcomp_type : {"gates","errorgens"}
        How errors are composed when creating layer operations in the associated
        model.  See :method:`CloudnoiseModel.__init__` for details.

    """
    Create an n-qubit gate that is a composition of:

    `targetOp(target_qubits) -> idle_noise(all_qubits) -> loc_noise(local_qubits)`

    where `idle_noise` is given by the `idle_noise` argument and `loc_noise` is
    given by the rest of the arguments.  `loc_noise` can be implemented either
    by a single (n-qubit) embedded Lindblad gate with all relevant error
    generators, or as a composition of embedded single-error-term Lindblad gates
    (see param `errcomp_type`).

    The local noise consists terms up to a maximum weight acting on the qubits
    given reachable by a given maximum number of hops (along the neareset-
    neighbor edges of `qubitGraph`) from the target qubits.


    Parameters
    ----------
    target_qubit_inds : list
        The indices of the target qubits.

    qubitGraph : QubitGraph
        A graph giving the geometry (nearest-neighbor relations) of the qubits.

    weight_maxhops_tuples : iterable
        A list of `(weight,maxhops)` 2-tuples specifying which error weights
        should be included and what region of the graph (as a `maxhops` from
        the set of target qubits) should have errors of the given weight applied
        to it.

    errcomp_type : {"gates","errorgens"}
        How errors are composed when creating layer operations in the associated
        model.  See :method:`CloudnoiseModel.__init__` for details.

    sparse : bool, optional
        Whether the embedded Lindblad-parameterized gates within the constructed
        gate are represented as sparse or dense matrices.  (This is determied by
        whether they are constructed using sparse basis matrices.)

    sim_type : {"matrix","map","termorder:<N>"}
        The type of forward simulation (probability computation) being used by
        the model this gate is destined for.  This affects what type of
        gate objects (e.g. `ComposedDenseOp` vs `ComposedOp`) are created.

    parameterization : str
        The type of parameterizaton for the constructed gate. E.g. "H+S",
        "H+S terms", "H+S clifford terms", "CPTP", etc.

    verbosity : int, optional
        An integer >= 0 dictating how must output to send to stdout.

    """
    The layer lizard class for a :class:`CloudNoiseModel`, which
    creates layers by composing perfect target gates, global idle error,
    and local "cloud" errors.

    The value of `model._lizardArgs['errcomp_type']` determines which of two
    composition strategies are employed.  When the errcomp_type is `"gates"`,
    the errors on multiple gates in a single layer are composed as separate
    and subsequent processes.  Specifically, the layer operation has the form
    `Composed(target,idleErr,cloudErr)` where `target` is a composition of all
    the ideal gate operations in the layer, `idleErr` is idle error
    (`.operation_blks['layers']['globalIdle']`), and `cloudErr` is the
    composition (ordered as layer-label) of cloud-noise contributions, i.e. a
    map that acts as the product of exponentiated error-generator matrices.
    `"errorgens"`, on the other hand, means that layer operations have the form
    `Composed(target, error)` where `target` is as above and `error` results
    from composing the idle and cloud-noise error *generators*, i.e. a map that
    acts as the exponentiated sum of error generators (ordering is irrelevant in
    this case).

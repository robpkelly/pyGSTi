    """
    An collection of compilations for gates. Essentially an ordered dictionary
    whose keys are operation labels (:class:`Label` objects) and whose values are
    operation sequences (:class:`Circuit` objects).  A `CompilationLibrary` holds a
    :class:`Model` which specifies the "native" gates that all compilations
    are made up of.  Currently, this model should only contain Clifford
    gates, so that its `get_clifford_symplectic_reps` method gives
    representations for all of its gates.

    Compilations can be either "local" or "non-local". A local compilation
    ony uses gates that act on its target qubits.  All 1-qubit gates can be
    local.  A non-local compilation uses qubits outside the set of target
    qubits (e.g. a CNOT between two qubits between which there is no native
    CNOT).  Currently, non-local compilations can only be constructed for
    the CNOT gate.

    To speed up the creation of local compilations, a `CompilationLibrary`
    stores "template" compilations, which specify how to construct a
    compilation for some k-qubit gate on qubits labeled 0 to k-1.  When creating
    a compilation for a gate, a template is used if a suitable one can be found;
    otherwise a new template is created and then used.

    Compilation libraries are most often used within a :class:`ProcessorSpec`
    object.

        clifford_model : Model
            The model of "native" Clifford gates which all compilations in

        ctyp : {"absolute","paulieq"}
            The "compilation type" for this library.  If `"absolute"`, then
            compilations must match the gate operation being compiled exactly.

        Constructs a local compilation of `oplabel`.

        An existing template is used if one is available, otherwise a new
        template is created using an iterative procedure. Raises
        :class:`CompilationError` when no compilation can be found.

        Parameters
        ----------
        oplabel : Label
            The label of the gate to compile.  If `oplabel.name` is a
            recognized standard Clifford name (e.g. 'H', 'P', 'X', 'CNOT')
            then no further information is needed.  Otherwise, you must specify
            either (or both) of `unitary` or `srep` *unless* the compilation
            for this oplabel has already been previously constructed and force
            is `False`. In that case, the previously constructed compilation will
            be returned in all cases, and so this method does not need to know
            what the gate actually is.

        unitary : numpy.ndarray, optional
            The unitary action of the gate being compiled.  If, as is typical,
            you're compiling using Clifford gates, then this unitary should
            correspond to a Clifford operation.  If you specify `unitary`,
            you don't need to specify `srep` - it is computed automatically.

        srep : tuple, optional
            The `(smatrix, svector)` tuple giving the symplectic representation
            of the gate being compiled.

        max_iterations : int, optional
            The maximum number of iterations for the iterative compilation
            algorithm.

        force : bool, optional
            If True, then a compilation is recomputed even if `oplabel`
            already exists in this `CompilationLibrary`.  Otherwise
            compilations are only computed when they are *not* present.

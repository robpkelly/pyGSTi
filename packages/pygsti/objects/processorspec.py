        Initializes a ProcessorSpec object.

        The most basic information required for a ProcessorSpec object is the number of qubits in the
        device, and the library of "native" target gates, which are specified as unitary matrices
        (using `nonstd_gate_unitaries`) or using default gate-names known to pyGSTi, such as 'Gcnot'
        for the CNOT gate (using `gate_names`). The other core information is the availability of the
        gates (specified via `availability`).

        Parameters
        ----------
        nQubits : int
            The number of qubits in the device.

        gate_names : list of strings
            The names of gates in the device that correspond to standard gates known by pyGSTi.
            The set of standard gates includes, but is not limited to:

            - 'Gi' : the 1Q idle operation
            - 'Gx','Gy','Gz' : 1-qubit pi/2 rotations
            - 'Gxpi','Gypi','Gzpi' : 1-qubit pi rotations
            - 'Gh' : Hadamard
            - 'Gp' : phase or S-gate (i.e., ((1,0),(0,i)))
            - 'Gcphase','Gcnot','Gswap' : standard 2-qubit gates

            Alternative names can be used for all or any of these gates, but then they must be explicitly defined
            in the `nonstd_gate_unitaries` dictionary.

        nonstd_gate_unitaries: dictionary of numpy arrays
            A dictionary with keys that are gate names (strings) and values that are numpy arrays specifying
            quantum gates in terms of unitary matrices. Together with the gates specified in the `gate_names`
            list, these matrices specify the set of all (target) native gates that can be implemented in the device.
            as unitaries acting on ordinary pure-state-vectors, in the standard computationl basis. These unitaries
            need not, and often should not, be unitaries acting on all of the qubits. E.g., a CNOT gate is specified
            by a key that is the desired name for CNOT, and a value that is the standard 4 x 4 complex matrix for CNOT.
            All gate names must start with 'G'.

        availability : dict, optional
            A dictionary whose keys are some subset of the keys (which are gate names) `nonstd_gate_unitaries`
            and the strings (which are gate names) in `gate_names` and whose values are lists of qubit-label-tuples.
            Each qubit-label-tuple must have length equal to the number of qubits the corresponding gate acts upon,
            and causes that gate to be available to act on the specified qubits. Instead of a list of tuples, values
            of `availability` may take the special values `"all-permutations"` and `"all-combinations"`, which as their names
            imply, equate to all possible permutations and combinations of the appropriate number of qubit labels (deterined
            by the gate's dimension). If a gate name is not present in `availability`, the default is `"all-permutations"`.
            So, the availability of a gate only needs to be specified when it cannot act in every valid way on the qubits
            (e.g., the device does not have all-to-all connectivity).

        construct_models : tuple, optional
            Standard model for the gates to add.
                - If 'target' is in the tuple, "target" process matrices corresponding to ideal gates are added.
                - If 'clifford' is in the tuple, the Clifford gates in the model are represented in their efficient-in-n
                symplectic form (these are reps. of perfect gates).

        construct_clifford_compilations : dict, optional
            The compilations for "standard" Clifford gates that are constructed. These are mostly only of importance for
            compiling many-qubit Clifford gates, and similar tasks related to creating randomized benchmarking circuits.
            The standard option is exhaustive (i.e., there are no further allowed options), and leaving this as-is should
            be fine for most purposes.

        verbosity : int, optional
            If > 0, information about the generation of the ProcessorSpec is printed to the screen.

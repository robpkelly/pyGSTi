# This is just a "loader" module which either loads the (fast)
# Cython/C++ version or the (slower) Python version of the
# collection of objects and functions termed a "representation library".

# The bit of logic involved is that we want to display a slowness
# warning only when the user actually *uses* the slower python
# routines, and not immediately upon importing the python version.
# To acheive this, instead of importing '*' directly, we decorate
# the functions as they are imported.

#Maybe in the FUTURE we'll remove the decorator action once the warning
#  has been issued?

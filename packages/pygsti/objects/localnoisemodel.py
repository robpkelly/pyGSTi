        """
        Creates a "standard" n-qubit model, usually of ideal gates, which
        is capable of describing "local noise", that is, noise/error that only
        acts on the *target qubits* of a given gate.

        For example, in a model with 4 qubits, a X(pi/2) gate on the 2nd
        qubit (which might be labelled something like `("Gx",1)`) can only
        act non-trivially on the 2nd qubit in a local noise model.  Because
        of a local noise  model's limitations, it is often used for describing
        ideal gates or very simple perturbations of them.

        The returned model is "standard", in that the following standard gate
        names may be specified as elements to `gate_names` without the need to
        supply their corresponding unitaries (as one must when calling
        the constructor directly):

        - 'Gi' : the 1Q idle operation
        - 'Gx','Gy','Gz' : 1Q pi/2 rotations
        - 'Gxpi','Gypi','Gzpi' : 1Q pi rotations
        - 'Gh' : Hadamard
        - 'Gp' : phase
        - 'Gcphase','Gcnot','Gswap' : standard 2Q gates

        Furthermore, if additional "non-standard" gates are needed,
        they are specified by their *unitary* gate action, even if
        the final model propagates density matrices (as opposed
        to state vectors).

        Parameters
        ----------
        nQubits : int
            The total number of qubits.

        gate_names : list
            A list of string-type gate names (e.g. `"Gx"`) either taken from
            the list of builtin "standard" gate names given above or from the
            keys of `nonstd_gate_unitaries`.  These are the typically 1- and 2-qubit
            gates that are repeatedly embedded (based on `availability`) to form
            the resulting model.

        nonstd_gate_unitaries : dict, optional
            A dictionary of numpy arrays which specifies the unitary gate action
            of the gate names given by the dictionary's keys.

        availability : dict, optional
            A dictionary whose keys are the same gate names as in
            `gate_names` and whose values are lists of qubit-label-tuples.  Each
            qubit-label-tuple must have length equal to the number of qubits
            the corresponding gate acts upon, and specifies that the named gate
            is available to act on the specified qubits.  For example,
            `{ 'Gx': [(0,),(1,),(2,)], 'Gcnot': [(0,1),(1,2)] }` would cause
            the `1-qubit `'Gx'`-gate to be available for acting on qubits
            0, 1, or 2, and the 2-qubit `'Gcnot'`-gate to be availalbe to
            act on qubits 0 & 1 or 1 & 2.  Instead of a list of tuples, values of
            `availability` may take the special values `"all-permutations"` and
            `"all-combinations"`, which as their names imply, equate to all possible
            permutations and combinations of the appropriate number of qubit labels
            (deterined by the gate's dimension).  The default value `"all-edges"`
            equates to all the edges in the graph given by `geometry`.

        qubit_labels : tuple, optional
            The circuit-line labels for each of the qubits, which can be integers
            and/or strings.  Must be of length `nQubits`.  If None, then the
            integers from 0 to `nQubits-1` are used.

        geometry : {"line","ring","grid","torus"} or QubitGraph
            The type of connectivity among the qubits, specifying a
            graph used to define neighbor relationships.  Alternatively,
            a :class:`QubitGraph` object with node labels equal to
            `qubit_labels` may be passed directly.

        parameterization : {"full", "TP", "CPTP", "H+S", "S", "static", "H+S terms",
                            "H+S clifford terms", "clifford"}
            The type of parameterizaton to use for each gate value before it is
            embedded. See :method:`ExplicitOpModel.set_all_parameterizations`
            for more details.

        evotype : {"auto","densitymx","statevec","stabilizer","svterm","cterm"}
            The evolution type.  Often this is determined by the choice of
            `parameterization` and can be left as `"auto"`, which prefers
            `"densitymx"` (full density matrix evolution) when possible. In some
            cases, however, you may want to specify this manually.  For instance,
            if you give unitary maps instead of superoperators in `gatedict`
            you'll want to set this to `"statevec"`.

        sim_type : {"auto", "matrix", "map", "termorder:<N>"}
            The simulation method used to compute predicted probabilities for the
            resulting :class:`Model`.  Usually `"auto"` is fine, the default for
            each `evotype` is usually what you want.  Setting this to something
            else is expert-level tuning.

        on_construction_error : {'raise','warn',ignore'}
            What to do when the creation of a gate with the given
            `parameterization` fails.  Usually you'll want to `"raise"` the error.
            In some cases, for example when converting as many gates as you can
            into `parameterization="clifford"` gates, `"warn"` or even `"ignore"`
            may be useful.

        independent_gates : bool, optional
            Whether gates are allowed independent local noise or not.  If False,
            then all gates with the same name (e.g. "Gx") will have the *same*
            (local) noise (e.g. an overrotation by 1 degree), and the
            `operation_bks['gates']` dictionary contains a single key per gate
            name.  If True, then gates with the same name acting on different
            qubits may have different local noise, and so the
            `operation_bks['gates']` dictionary contains a key for each gate
             available gate placement.

        ensure_composed_gates : bool, optional
            If True then the elements of the `operation_bks['gates']` will always
            be either :class:`ComposedDenseOp` (if `sim_type == "matrix"`) or
            :class:`ComposedOp` (othewise) objects.  The purpose of this is to
            facilitate modifying the gate operations after the model is created.
            If False, then the appropriately parameterized gate objects (often
            dense gates) are used directly.

        globalIdle : LinearOperator, optional
            A global idle operation, which is performed once at the beginning
            of every circuit layer.  If `None`, no such operation is performed.
            If a 1-qubit operator is given and `nQubits > 1` the global idle
            is the parallel application of this operator on each qubit line.
            Otherwise the given operator must act on all `nQubits` qubits.

        """
        Creates a n-qubit model by embedding the *same* gates from `gatedict`
        as requested and creating a perfect 0-prep and z-basis POVM.

        The gates in `gatedict` often act on fewer (typically just 1 or 2) than
        the total `nQubits` qubits, in which case embedded-gate objects are
        automatically (and repeatedly) created to wrap the lower-dimensional gate.
        Parameterization of each gate is done once, before any embedding, so that
        just a single set of parameters will exist for each low-dimensional gate.

        Parameters
        ----------
        nQubits : int
            The total number of qubits.

        gatedict : dict
            A dictionary (an `OrderedDict` if you care about insertion order) which
            associates with string-type gate names (e.g. `"Gx"`) :class:`LinearOperator`,
            `numpy.ndarray` objects. When the objects may act on fewer than the total
            number of qubits (determined by their dimension/shape) then they are
            repeatedly embedded into `nQubits`-qubit gates as specified by `availability`.

        availability : dict, optional
            A dictionary whose keys are the same gate names as in
            `gatedict` and whose values are lists of qubit-label-tuples.  Each
            qubit-label-tuple must have length equal to the number of qubits
            the corresponding gate acts upon, and causes that gate to be
            embedded to act on the specified qubits.  For example,
            `{ 'Gx': [(0,),(1,),(2,)], 'Gcnot': [(0,1),(1,2)] }` would cause
            the `1-qubit `'Gx'`-gate to be embedded three times, acting on qubits
            0, 1, and 2, and the 2-qubit `'Gcnot'`-gate to be embedded twice,
            acting on qubits 0 & 1 and 1 & 2.  Instead of a list of tuples,
            values of `availability` may take the special values
            `"all-permutations"` and `"all-combinations"`, which as their names
            imply, equate to all possible permutations and combinations of the
            appropriate number of qubit labels (deterined by the gate's dimension).
            If a gate name (a key of `gatedict`) is not present in `availability`,
            the default is `"all-permutations"`.

        parameterization : {"full", "TP", "CPTP", "H+S", "S", "static", "H+S terms",
                            "H+S clifford terms", "clifford"}
            The type of parameterizaton to convert each value in `gatedict` to. See
            :method:`ExplicitOpModel.set_all_parameterizations` for more details.

        evotype : {"auto","densitymx","statevec","stabilizer","svterm","cterm"}
            The evolution type.  Often this is determined by the choice of
            `parameterization` and can be left as `"auto"`, which prefers
            `"densitymx"` (full density matrix evolution) when possible. In some
            cases, however, you may want to specify this manually.  For instance,

            each `evotype` is usually what you want.  Setting this to something
            else is expert-level tuning.

        on_construction_error : {'raise','warn',ignore'}
            What to do when the conversion from a value in `gatedict` to a
            :class:`LinearOperator` of the type given by `parameterization` fails.
            Usually you'll want to `"raise"` the error.  In some cases,

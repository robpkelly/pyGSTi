        ----------
        itemWeights : dict, optional
            Dictionary of weighting factors for individual gates and spam operators.
            Keys can be gate, state preparation, POVM effect, spam labels, or the

        # sub-space (the non-gauge space in particular).
        #
        # Within the Model H-space lies a gauge-manifold of maximum chi2 (16-dimensional in 1Q case),
        #  where the gauge-invariant chi2 function is constant.  At a single point (Model) P on this manifold,
        #  chosen by (somewhat arbitrarily) fixing the gauge, we can talk about the tangent space
        #  at that point.  This tangent space is spanned by some basis (~16 elements for the 1Q case),
        #  which associate with the infinitesimal gauge transform ?generators? on the full space.
        #  The subspace of H spanned by the derivatives w.r.t gauge transformations at P (a Model) spans
        #  the gauge space, and the complement of this (in H) is the non-gauge space.
        #
        #  An element of the gauge group can be written gg = exp(-K), where K is a n x n matrix.  If K is
        #   hermitian then gg is unitary, but this need not be the case.  A gauge transform acts on a
        #   gatset via Model => gg^-1 G gg, i.e. G => exp(K) G exp(-K).  We care about the action of
        #   infinitesimal gauge tranformations (b/c the *derivative* vectors span the tangent space),
        #   which act as:
        #    G => (I+K) G (I-K) = G + [K,G] + ignored(K^2), where [K,G] := KG-GK
        #
        # To produce a projector onto the gauge-space, we compute the *column* vectors

        #  (to project onto |v1>, |v2>, etc., form P = sum_i |v_i><v_i|)
        #
        #Typically nOpParams < len(dG_ij) and linear system is overconstrained
        #   and no solution is expected.  If no solution exists, simply ignore
        #
        # So we form P = sum_ij dG_ij * transpose(dG_ij) (56x56 in 1Q case)
        #              = dG * transpose(dG)              where dG_ij form the *columns* of dG (56x16 in 1Q case)

        #  since the pseudo-inv is defined by P*pseudo-inv(P) = I and so P'P' == P'
        #  and P' is our gauge-projector!

        # Note: In the general case of parameterized gates (i.e. non-fully parameterized gates), there are fewer
        #   gate parameters than the size of dG_ij ( < 56 in 1Q case).  In this general case, we want to know
        #   what (if any) change in gate parameters produces the change dG_ij of the operation matrix elements.
        #   That is, we solve dG_ij = derivWRTParams * dParams_ij for dParams_ij, where derivWRTParams is
        #   the derivative of the operation matrix elements with respect to the gate parameters (derivWRTParams
        #   is 56x(nOpParams) and dParams_ij is (nOpParams)x1 in the 1Q case) -- then substitute dG_ij
        #   with dParams_ij above to arrive at a (nOpParams)x(nOpParams) projector (compatible with
        #   hessian computed by model).
        #
        #   Actually, we want to know if what changes gate parameters

        #   This intersection is determined by nullspace( derivWRTParams | dG ), where the pipe denotes

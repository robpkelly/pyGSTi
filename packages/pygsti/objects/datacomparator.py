        non-default settings, this is some minor variation on that method.

        Note that the default values of all the parameters are likely sufficient for most
        purposes.

        Parameters
        ----------
        significance : float in (0,1), optional (default is 0.05)
            The "global" statistical significance to implement the tests at. I.e, with
            the standard `per_sequence_correction` value (and some other values for this parameter)
            the probability that a sequence that has been flagged up as context dependent
            is actually from a context-independent circuit is no more than `significance`.
            Precisely, `significance` is what the "family-wise error rate" (FWER) of the full set
            of hypothesis tests (1 "aggregate test", and 1 test per sequence) is controlled to,
            as long as `per_sequence_correction` is set to the default value, or another option
            that controls the FWER of the per-sequence comparion (see below).

        per_sequence_correction : string, optional (default is 'Hochberg')
            The multi-hypothesis test correction used for the per-circuit/sequence comparisons.
            (See "Probing context-dependent errors in quantum processors", by Rudinger et al. for
            the details of what the per-circuit comparison is). This can be any string that is an allowed
            value for the `localcorrections` input parameter of the HypothesisTest object. This includes:

                - 'Hochberg'. This implements the Hochberg multi-test compensation technique. This
                is strictly the best method available in the code, if you wish to control the FWER,
                and it is the method described in "Probing context-dependent errors in quantum processors",
                by Rudinger et al.

                - 'Holms'. This implements the Holms multi-test compensation technique. This
                controls the FWER, and it results in a strictly less powerful test than the Hochberg
                correction.

                - 'Bonferroni'. This implements the well-known Bonferroni multi-test compensation
                technique. This controls the FWER, and it results in a strictly less powerful test than
                the Hochberg correction.

                - 'none'. This implements no multi-test compensation for the per-sequence comparsions,
                so they are all implemented at a "local" signifincance level that is altered from `significance`
                only by the (inbuilt) Bonferroni-like correction between the "aggregate" test and the per-sequence
                tests. This option does *not* control the FWER, and many sequences may be flagged up as context
                dependent even if none are.

                -'Benjamini-Hochberg'. This implements the Benjamini-Hockberg multi-test compensation
                technique. This does *not* control the FWER, and instead controls the "False Detection Rate"
                (FDR); see, for example, https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/False_discovery_rate. That means that
                the global significance is maintained for the test of "Is there any context dependence?". I.e.,
                one or more tests will trigger when there is no context
                dependence with at most a probability of `significance`. But, if one or more per-sequence tests
                trigger then we are only guaranteed that (in expectation) no more than a fraction of
                "local-signifiance" of the circuits that have been flagged up as context dependent actually aren't.
                Here, "local-significance" is the  significance at which the per-sequence tests are, together,
                implemented, which is `significance`*(1 - `aggregate_test_weighting`) if the aggregate test doesn't
                detect context dependence and `significance` if it does (as long as `pass_alpha` is True). This
                method is strictly more powerful than the Hochberg correction, but it controls a different, weaker
                quantity.

        aggregate_test_weighting : float in [0,1], optional (default is 0.5)
            The weighting, in a generalized Bonferroni correction, to put on the "aggregate test", that jointly
            tests all of the data for context dependence (in contrast to the per-sequence tests). If this is 0 then
            the aggreate test is not implemented, and if it is 1 only the aggregate test is implemented (unless it
            triggers and `pass_alpha` is True).

        pass_alpha : Bool, optional (default is True)

            The aggregate test is implemented first, at the "local" significance defined by `aggregate_test_weighting`
            and `significance` (see above). If `pass_alpha` is True, then when the aggregate test triggers all the
            local significance for this test is passed on to the per-sequence tests (which are then jointly implemented
            with significance `significance`, that is then locally corrected for the multi-test correction as specified
            above), and when the aggregate test doesn't trigger this local significance isn't passed on. If `pass_alpha`
            is False then local significance of the aggregate test is never passed on from the aggregate test. See
